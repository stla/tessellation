Description: Delaunay and Voronoï tessellations, with emphasis on the
    two-dimensional and the three-dimensional cases (the package provides
    functions to plot the tessellations for these cases). Delaunay
    tessellations are computed in C with the help of the 'Qhull' library
    <http://www.qhull.org/>.
